# Background and Motivation
The user needs a brute-force utility that iterates over all BIP-39 English words for the 5th position of a known 24-word mnemonic, checking for the correct address.  This is an ad-hoc recovery scenario, not a production feature.

# Key Challenges and Analysis
- Need to load an almost-complete mnemonic from YAML while allowing one blank slot.
- Validate candidate mnemonics efficiently (wordlist, checksum).
- Derive Ethereum address with existing `WalletDeriver`, trying standard paths.

# High-level Task Breakdown
- [x] Create dedicated YAML config (`data/wallets/wallet_word5.yaml`) with blank 5th word.
  - Success criteria: YAML contains 24 elements with one empty string; lints clean.
- [x] Implement script `test2.py` at repo root.
  - Success criteria: imports resolve, no linter errors, runs without arguments, brute-forces over 2,048 words.
- [ ] Manual test / user confirmation that script finds or does not find the mnemonic.

# Project Status Board
- [x] Add YAML config for 5th word search
- [x] Add brute-force script `test2.py`
- [ ] Await user to execute script and verify results

# Current Status / Progress Tracking
Executor has implemented the YAML config and brute-force script.  Linter passes locally.

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
Please run `python test2.py` and confirm whether it identifies the correct mnemonic.  Let me know the outcome or provide any errors encountered so I can address them.

# Lessons
- Reused existing validation and derivation classes to avoid duplicate logic.
